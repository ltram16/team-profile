# Team Profile Generator

This repository contains a team profile generator that is run through the command line using Node.js. The application uses the inquirer package to present a set of questions to the user about each employee in their team, which are categorized into these classes: Employee, Manager, Employee, and Intern. Once the application retrieves the data, it will render an HTML document that lists the profiles of each team member with the information provided.
